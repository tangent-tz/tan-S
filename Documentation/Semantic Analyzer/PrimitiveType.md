The `PrimitiveType` class is an enumeration (`enum`) that represents the different primitive types that can be used in the language being compiled. This enumeration also implements the `Type` interface, indicating that it has methods that all types should have, such as a method to get the size of a variable of the type in bytes.

Each item in the `enum` represents a different primitive type. The types defined in this `enum` are:

- `BOOLEAN`: represents a boolean value, which is given a size of 1 byte.
- `CHARACTER`: represents a character value, which is given a size of 1 byte.
- `INTEGER`: represents an integer value, which is given a size of 4 bytes.
- `FLOAT`: represents a floating-point value, which is given a size of 8 bytes.
- `ERROR`: represents a special type used when a syntax error has occurred. It has a size of 0, indicating that it should not occupy any space, as it is not a real data type.
- `NO_TYPE`: represents a special type used when no type has been assigned. It also has a size of 0.

Each item in the `enum` also has an associated `infoString`, which appears to be used for diagnostic or logging purposes. The `infoString` is set to the name of the type in all cases except `NO_TYPE`, where it is an empty string.

The `getSize()` method is used to get the size of the type in bytes. The `infoString()` method is used to get the information string associated with the type. These methods can be useful for various parts of the compiler, such as for deciding how much space to allocate for a variable of a certain type or for providing detailed error messages.
