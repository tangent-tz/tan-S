Code defines an abstract class ScannerImp which implements a Scanner interface. This class is a part of the lexical analysis stage in a compiler where an input character stream is read and transformed into a sequence of tokens. Let's break down the structure of the code:

private Token nextToken;: A private variable that holds the next token in the sequence.

protected final PushbackCharStream input;: A PushbackCharStream variable marked as final, indicating that the input stream should not be modified.

protected abstract Token findNextToken();: This abstract method is supposed to be implemented in the subclass and is used to find the next token in the input stream.

The constructor ScannerImp(PushbackCharStream input) assigns the provided input to the input field and finds the next token in the stream by calling findNextToken().

public boolean hasNext(): This method checks whether the next token is a NullToken or not. If it is, the method returns false meaning there are no more tokens in the sequence; if it's not a NullToken, it returns true, indicating there are more tokens to process.

public Token next(): This method returns the next token in the sequence and then fetches the subsequent token by calling findNextToken().

public void remove(): This method throws an UnsupportedOperationException because removing elements from the token sequence is not supported.
