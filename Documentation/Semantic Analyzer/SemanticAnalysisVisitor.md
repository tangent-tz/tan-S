The `SemanticAnalysisVisitor` class is a visitor that traverses the parse tree generated by the parser in the compiler. Each method in this class corresponds to a type of node in the parse tree, and defines the actions to be taken when entering or leaving that type of node during the traversal. This class is part of the semantic analysis phase of a compiler, where the compiler verifies that the code obeys certain rules beyond those of the syntax. For example, it checks whether variables have been declared before they are used, whether functions are called with the correct number and types of arguments, whether the types on either side of an assignment operator match, etc.

Here's a breakdown of some of the key methods:

1. `visitEnter(ProgramNode node)`: This is called when the traversal enters a `ProgramNode`, which represents the entire program. It creates a new scope for the program.

2. `visitLeave(ProgramNode node)`: Called when the traversal is leaving a `ProgramNode`. It leaves the current scope, essentially finalizing it.

3. `visitLeave(DeclarationNode node)`: Called when leaving a `DeclarationNode`, which represents a variable or constant declaration. It retrieves the identifier and the initializer, checks their types, and adds a new binding to the scope if the types are compatible.

4. `visitLeave(AssignmentStatementNode node)`: Called when leaving an `AssignmentStatementNode`, representing an assignment statement. It checks whether the types of the identifier and the expression match, and whether the identifier is constant.

5. `visitEnter(BlockStatementNode node)`: Called when entering a `BlockStatementNode`, which represents a block of code. It creates a new scope for the block.

6. `visitLeave(BlockStatementNode node)`: Called when leaving a `BlockStatementNode`. It leaves the current scope.

7. `visitLeave(OperatorNode node)`: Called when leaving an `OperatorNode`, representing an operation like addition, subtraction, etc. It checks whether the operation is defined for the given types, and sets the type of the result accordingly.

8. `visit(IdentifierNode node)`: Called when visiting an `IdentifierNode`, representing a variable or constant identifier. If the identifier is not being declared, it retrieves the binding from the scope and sets the type of the identifier accordingly.

Now, let's consider an example of how this would be used. Suppose you have the following code:

```
{
    int x = 5;
    int y = x + 3;
    x = y * 2;
}
```

During the semantic analysis phase, the `SemanticAnalysisVisitor` would traverse the parse tree corresponding to this code. Upon entering the block, it would call `visitEnter(BlockStatementNode node)`, creating a new scope.

When it encounters the declaration `int x = 5;`, it would call `visitLeave(DeclarationNode node)`, where it would check that the types of the identifier `x` and the initializer `5` match, and add a binding for `x` to the current scope.

Then, for `int y = x + 3;`, it would first call `visit(IdentifierNode node)` for `x`, retrieve the binding for `x` from the scope, and check that `x` has been declared. Then, it would call `visitLeave(OperatorNode node)` for `x + 3`, check that the `+` operation is defined for two integers, and set the type of `x + 3` as integer. Finally, it would call `visitLeave(DeclarationNode node)` for `y`, check that the types of `y` and `x +

3` match, and add a binding for `y` to the current scope.

Finally, for `x = y * 2;`, it would perform similar steps to the previous statement, additionally checking in `visitLeave(AssignmentStatementNode node)` that `x` is not constant.

Upon leaving the block, it would call `visitLeave(BlockStatementNode node)`, leaving the current scope. This would essentially discard the bindings for `x` and `y`, as they are no longer in scope outside the block.

In this way, the `SemanticAnalysisVisitor` ensures that the code is semantically correct: variables are declared before they are used, the operations are defined for the given types, and the types on either side of an assignment operator match. If any of these checks fail, it would log an error and set the type of the offending node to `ERROR`.
