PunctuatorScanner class in our code is used to scan through an input stream and tokenize punctuators (symbols or characters like "+", "-", "*", "/", "(", ")", etc. used in a programming language) from it. Here's a brief summary of what each part does:

Class variables:

private PushbackCharStream input;: A PushbackCharStream object that provides the input stream of characters to be tokenized.
private PartiallyScannedPunctuator scanned;: A PartiallyScannedPunctuator object that represents the current state of the scanned punctuator.
Public static method scan(LocatedChar startingCharacter, PushbackCharStream input): This is the entry point to the class. It creates a PunctuatorScanner object and uses it to scan the input stream, starting from the given character, for a punctuator token.

Private constructor PunctuatorScanner(LocatedChar startingCharacter, PushbackCharStream input): Initializes the input and scanned variables.

Private method scanPunctuator(): This is a recursive method that does the actual scanning of the input. It works as follows:

It first checks if the scanned token corresponds to a valid punctuator.
If there is exactly one matching punctuator and scanned is a punctuator, it returns the corresponding token.
If there are no matching punctuators or there's no more input, it rolls back the scanned input until the last valid punctuator and returns the corresponding token.
If none of the above conditions are met, it continues scanning by adding the next character from the input to scanned and recursing.
Private method backupToLastPunctuatorPrefix(): This method rolls back the scanned input until it reaches a valid punctuator. It does this by continuously removing the last character from scanned and pushing it back onto the input until scanned is a punctuator or is empty.

In general, the scanner works by continuously extending a candidate punctuator and checking if it corresponds to a valid punctuator. If it does, it stops scanning and returns the corresponding token. If it doesn't, and there are no more valid punctuators that could be formed by extending the candidate, it rolls back the input until the last valid punctuator, returns the corresponding token, and leaves the rest of the input for subsequent scanning. If there's no more input, it does the same thing.


Let's go through an example. Suppose you are working on a scanner for a programming language which has the following punctuators: "+", "-", "*", "/", "=", "==". And you have an input stream of characters: "===+". Here's how PunctuatorScanner would tokenize it:

Initially, scanned is empty. The scanner calls scanPunctuator() with the first character of the input, which is "=".

It checks if scanned corresponds to a valid punctuator. At this point, scanned is "=", which is a valid punctuator. But there's also a possibility it could be part of the "==", so the scanner adds the next character from the input to scanned and recurses.

Now, scanned is "==", which is still a valid punctuator. But there's still a possibility it could be part of a longer punctuator, so the scanner adds the next character from the input to scanned and recurses.

Now, scanned is "===", which is not a valid punctuator. There are also no valid punctuators that could be formed by extending scanned further, so the scanner rolls back the input until the last valid punctuator.

The scanner calls backupToLastPunctuatorPrefix(), which continuously removes the last character from scanned and pushes it back onto the input until scanned is a valid punctuator. In this case, it removes the last "=", pushing it back onto the input. Now, scanned is "==", which is a valid punctuator.

scanPunctuator() returns the token corresponding to the punctuator "==". The input stream is now "==+".

The scanner would then continue scanning the remaining input in the same way.

In the end, the PunctuatorScanner would have tokenized the input "===+" into "==", "=", "+".

Please note that this example assumes the existence of a PartiallyScannedPunctuator class and methods to handle the tokens, which are not provided in the code you shared. These would be necessary for the PunctuatorScanner class to function as expected.
