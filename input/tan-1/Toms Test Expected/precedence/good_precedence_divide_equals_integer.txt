Based on the code, the expected output would be a series of boolean values separated by new lines (\n). The boolean values would be true if the calculation on the left side of the equality operator (==) is equal to the value on the right side, and false otherwise. 

For example, the first line of code would output "true" because 60 divided by 25 is equal to 2, and 2 is equal to 22. 

The second line of code would output "false" because 81 divided by 49 is equal to 1.653, which is not equal to 14. 

Similarly, the third line of code would output "false" because 96 divided by 3 is equal to 32, which is not equal to 39. 

The rest of the lines of code would follow this pattern of performing a division calculation and comparing it to a given value, outputting true or false based on the result.
