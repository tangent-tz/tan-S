The `ReferenceType` class is also an enumeration (`enum`) that represents the different reference types that can be used in the language being compiled. Like `PrimitiveType`, this enumeration implements the `Type` interface.

In this enum, we only have one reference type defined:

- `STRING`: represents a string value, which is given a size of 4 bytes. The size indicates the size of the reference to the string, not the size of the string data itself. String data is usually stored separately on the heap in many languages, and the size of the reference to the string is often the size of a pointer (4 bytes on a 32-bit system).

For each item in the `enum`, an associated `infoString` is set to the name of the type.

The `getSize()` method is used to get the size of the type in bytes. The `infoString()` method is used to get the information string associated with the type. These methods would be useful for various parts of the compiler, like deciding how much space to allocate for a variable of a certain type, or for providing detailed error messages.
