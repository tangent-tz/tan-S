The PartiallyScannedPunctuator class represents a part of a punctuator (like parentheses, brackets, braces, operators etc.) that has been scanned from the input so far. It extends LocatedCharString, which is essentially a sequence of characters read from the input, each with its own location in the source code.

This class has several methods:

The isPunctuator method checks if the currently scanned characters form a valid punctuator as defined by the Punctuator enum.

The asPunctuator method attempts to convert the currently scanned characters into a Punctuator enum. If the current string doesn't represent a valid punctuator, it returns Punctuator.NULL_PUNCTUATOR.

The asToken method converts the currently scanned characters into a Token. If no characters have been scanned so far (i.e., the PartiallyScannedPunctuator is empty), it returns a NullToken. Otherwise, it asserts that the scanned string is a valid punctuator and then returns a LextantToken representing that punctuator.

This class is likely used by a scanner to handle the complexity of scanning punctuators, which can consist of multiple characters and can form part of other punctuators (e.g., = is a punctuator, but so is ==).

The scanner would gradually add characters to a PartiallyScannedPunctuator and regularly check if it forms a valid punctuator. This enables the scanner to correctly tokenize input like == as a single == token, rather than two separate = tokens.

#Example:

let's take an example to understand how PartiallyScannedPunctuator works. Consider a scenario where we have a PunctuatorScanner that uses PartiallyScannedPunctuator to help tokenize a string.

Let's take the string "a == b" for our scenario. Here '==' is a punctuator that we are interested in tokenizing correctly.

Here's a rough overview of how the process might look:

Initialization: A PunctuatorScanner starts to scan the string and when it encounters the first '=', it initializes a PartiallyScannedPunctuator with this character.


LocatedChar firstChar = new LocatedChar('=');
PartiallyScannedPunctuator scannedPunctuator = new PartiallyScannedPunctuator(firstChar);


Adding Characters: As the scanner reads the next character (which is also an '='), it adds it to the PartiallyScannedPunctuator.


LocatedChar secondChar = new LocatedChar('=');
scannedPunctuator.append(secondChar);


Checking Punctuator Validity: At each step, it would use isPunctuator() to check if the scanned characters form a valid punctuator. When only the first '=' was scanned, isPunctuator() would have returned true (since '=' is a valid punctuator), but the scanner kept going because the next character could potentially form a larger punctuator.


if (scannedPunctuator.isPunctuator()) {
    // ...
}

Conversion to Token: Once it encounters a character that can't form a larger punctuator (in this case, the whitespace after the second '='), it calls asToken() to convert the scanned characters into a token. This method would return a LextantToken with lexeme '==' and punctuator '==', which could then be used by the parser for further processing.


Token token = scannedPunctuator.asToken();
// token would be a LextantToken with lexeme '==' and punctuator '=='


In this way, PartiallyScannedPunctuator helps in recognizing and tokenizing multi-character punctuators correctly.
