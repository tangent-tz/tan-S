The expected output of the code is:

main {
	print length [14 + 21, 77] $n;
}

The code is calculating the length of an array and printing the result. The array contains two elements: the sum of 14 and 21, and the number 77. The variable $n is used to store the result of the length calculation.

To calculate the length of the array, we need to evaluate the expression [14 + 21, 77]. 

14 + 21 = 35
So, the array becomes [35, 77].

The length of the array is 2, so the expected output is:

2
