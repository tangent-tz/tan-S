The `SemanticAnalyzer` class you provided is responsible for performing semantic analysis on a given Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

The class has two main components:

1. The `analyze(ParseNode ASTree)` static method, which is the entry point for the semantic analysis process. It takes an AST as an argument, creates an instance of `SemanticAnalyzer` with this AST, and then performs the analysis.

2. The constructor `SemanticAnalyzer(ParseNode ASTree)`, which is used to create a new instance of `SemanticAnalyzer`, storing the AST that it will analyze.

3. The `analyze()` instance method performs the actual semantic analysis. It applies a `SemanticAnalysisVisitor` to the AST. This visitor will traverse the AST and perform semantic checks on each node.

Let's consider an example. If the compiler is parsing the following code:

```c
int x = 10;
```

The semantic analyzer will perform checks to ensure this code is semantically correct. The parser would have created an AST with a `DeclarationNode` for `int x = 10;`. The `SemanticAnalysisVisitor` will visit this node in the AST and perform the semantic checks such as verifying the types on both sides of the assignment are compatible, and adding the binding of `x` to the symbol table with its type `int`.

If all semantic checks pass, the `analyze()` method will return the (potentially modified) AST for further stages of the compilation process. If there are any semantic errors, the `SemanticAnalysisVisitor` will typically log them and the resulting AST will include nodes of type `ErrorNode`.
