The `LexicalAnalyzer` class is a crucial part of the lexical analysis (scanning) stage of a compiler. It reads the source code character by character, groups them into lexemes, and creates corresponding tokens.

The `findNextToken()` method is at the core of this class. It determines the type of the next token based on the first non-whitespace character:

- If the character is a digit, it calls `scanNumber(ch)` to scan a number token.
- If the character is an identifier starter, it calls `scanIdentifier(ch)` to scan an identifier or a keyword.
- If the character is a punctuator starter, it calls `PunctuatorScanner.scan(ch, input)` to scan a punctuator.
- If the character is a single or double quote, it calls `scanCharacterSingle(ch)` or `scanString(ch)` to scan a character or string literal.
- If none of the above conditions are met and the character is not the end of input, it logs a lexical error and tries to find the next token.


Remember, the `LexicalAnalyzer` class only creates tokens. It's up to the later stages of the compiler (like the parser) to check if the sequence of tokens is syntactically correct and makes sense in the programming language.

EXAMPLE:

Suppose we have the following simple program in a hypothetical language that the compiler understands:

```C
main() {
    var x = 5;
    print(x);
}
```

Here's a step-by-step example of how the lexical analyzer might process this program:

1. The analyzer starts by reading the first non-whitespace character `m`. Since it's an identifier starter, it triggers the `scanIdentifier` method. 

2. `scanIdentifier` continues to consume characters until it encounters a non-identifier character, the parentheses `(`. At this point, it has consumed the string `main`. The identifier `main` matches a keyword in this hypothetical language, so it generates a `KeywordToken` with the lexeme `main`.

3. The next non-whitespace character is `(`, which is a punctuator in this language. It triggers `PunctuatorScanner.scan` and creates a `PunctuatorToken` with the lexeme `(`.

4. This process continues, identifying `)` as a punctuator, `{` as a punctuator, `var` as a keyword, `x` as an identifier, `=` as a punctuator, `5` as a number, `;` as a punctuator, and so on.

5. The `print` function call is also identified as a keyword, and the argument `x` is identified as an identifier.

6. The process continues until all characters are consumed and all tokens are generated.

The result of lexical analysis might look something like this:

```C
KeywordToken at (1,1) lexeme='main'
PunctuatorToken at (1,5) lexeme='('
PunctuatorToken at (1,6) lexeme=')'
PunctuatorToken at (1,8) lexeme='{'
KeywordToken at (2,5) lexeme='var'
IdentifierToken at (2,9) lexeme='x'
PunctuatorToken at (2,11) lexeme=':='
NumberToken at (2,13) lexeme='5'
PunctuatorToken at (2,14) lexeme=';'
KeywordToken at (3,5) lexeme='print'
PunctuatorToken at (3,10) lexeme='('
IdentifierToken at (3,11) lexeme='x'
PunctuatorToken at (3,12) lexeme=')'
PunctuatorToken at (3,13) lexeme=';'
PunctuatorToken at (4,1) lexeme='}'
NullToken at (4,2)
```

Note that these are just example outputs. The actual output depends on the details of the language, such as the precise definition of keywords and punctuators, and the line and column numbering scheme. Also note that the parentheses around function arguments are treated as separate tokens, as are the semicolons marking the ends of statements.
