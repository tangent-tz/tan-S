The `FunctionSignature` class represents the signature of a function, which includes the types of its parameters and its return type. This class is used to check that function calls in the code have the right number and types of arguments, and to determine the type that a function call returns. Here's what each part of the class does:

- The `FunctionSignature` constructor initializes an instance of the class. It takes an array of `Type` objects, which represent the types of the parameters and the return type of the function. The last element of the array is the return type. It also takes a `whichVariant` parameter that might be used to handle different versions of a function with the same name but different parameter types (function overloading).

- `getVariant()`, `resultType()`, and `isNull()` are getter methods that return the variant of the function, its return type, and whether it's the null instance, respectively.

- `accepts(List<Type> types)` is used to check whether the function can accept a given list of parameter types.

- `assignableTo(Type variableType, Type valueType)` checks if a value of type `valueType` can be assigned to a variable of type `variableType`.

- `nullInstance()` returns a special `FunctionSignature` that represents a nonexistent function. This is used as a sentinel value to indicate that a function with a particular name and parameter types doesn't exist.

- The remaining static methods and fields represent specific function signatures for various built-in functions and operators. The signatures are represented as static fields, and there are methods to retrieve the appropriate signature based on the function name and parameter types.

For example, the `signatureOfInteger` method takes a `Lextant` (which represents an operator or function name) and returns the function signature for the operation when applied to integers. It does this by comparing the `Lextant` to each possible `Punctuator` (which represent specific operators), and returning the corresponding `FunctionSignature`. If the `Lextant` doesn't match any of the known `Punctuators`, it returns the "never matched" signature.

The "never matched" signature is another sentinel value, used to represent an operation that isn't defined for a particular set of parameter types. For example, if you tried to divide a string by an integer, `signatureOfString` would return the "never matched" signature because division isn't defined for strings and integers.

The signatures themselves are defined as static fields at the bottom of the class. Each one is an instance of `FunctionSignature` that's created with the appropriate types for its parameters and return value. For example, `subtractIntegerSignature` represents a function that takes two integers and returns an integer, which is the signature of the subtraction operation for integers.

In summary, the `FunctionSignature` class provides a way to represent and work with the signatures of functions in your language. It supports checking that function calls have the correct number and types of arguments, determining the return type of a function call, and handling different versions of a function with the same name but different parameter types.

Let's say our compiler is analyzing the following code:

```java
int x = 3;
        int y = 5;
        int z = x + y;
        float a = 3.0;
        float b = 4.0;
        float c = a / b;
```

A part of the compiler called the semantic analyzer might do something like the following:

```java
// ... other compiler code ...

public void analyzeAssignment(Variable targetVariable, Expression sourceExpression) {
        // Get the types of the target variable and the source expression
        Type targetType = targetVariable.getType();
        Type sourceType = sourceExpression.getType();

        // Check if the source expression is a binary operation
        if (sourceExpression instanceof BinaryOperation) {
        BinaryOperation operation = (BinaryOperation) sourceExpression;

        // Get the operator and operand types
        Lextant operator = operation.getOperator();
        Type operandType1 = operation.getOperand1().getType();
        Type operandType2 = operation.getOperand2().getType();

        // Get the appropriate function signature
        FunctionSignature signature;
        if (operandType1.equals(PrimitiveType.INTEGER)) {
        signature = FunctionSignature.signatureOfInteger(operator);
        } else if (operandType1.equals(PrimitiveType.FLOAT)) {
        signature = FunctionSignature.signatureOfFloat(operator);
        } else {
        // ... handle other types ...
        signature = FunctionSignature.nullInstance();  // Just for example purposes, do not let unknown types silently pass
        }

        // Check if the operation is valid
        if (signature.isNull()) {
        reportError("Operation " + operator + " not defined for type " + operandType1);
        return;
        }

        // Check if the result can be assigned to the target variable
        if (!signature.resultType().equals(targetType)) {
        reportError("Cannot assign value of type " + signature.resultType() + " to variable of type " + targetType);
        return;
        }
        } else {
        // ... handle other kinds of expressions ...
        }

        // ... other code to generate the output or abstract syntax tree ...
        }

// ... other compiler code ...
```

This function analyzes an assignment statement. It checks if the source expression is a binary operation. If it is, it retrieves the function signature for that operation and the operand types, then checks if the operation is valid and if the result can be assigned to the target variable. If either of these checks fail, it reports an error.
