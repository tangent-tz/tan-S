The `Punctuator` enum represents the various punctuators or operators that can be recognized in the language the compiler is designed to parse.

Each enum constant represents a specific punctuator in the language, such as `ADD` for '+', `SUBTRACT` for '-', `MULTIPLY` for '*', `DIVIDE` for '/', `EQUALS` for '==', `NOTEQUALS` for '!=', and so on.

Each `Punctuator` enum constant has associated with it:

1. A `lexeme` - The string that the punctuator represents in the language.

2. A `prototype` - A prototype token that represents an instance of the punctuator in the language. This is a `LextantToken`, which includes the location in the text where the lexeme is found, the lexeme itself, and the corresponding `Punctuator` constant.

The enum provides methods to:

- `getLexeme()`: Return the lexeme for a given punctuator.
- `prototype()`: Return the prototype token for a given punctuator.
- `forLexeme()`: Find the punctuator that corresponds to a given lexeme. If no matching punctuator is found, it returns `NULL_PUNCTUATOR`. This method is overloaded to accept both `String` and `Character` inputs.

For example, if the compiler is currently processing the character '+', we can use the `Punctuator.forLexeme('+')` method to find the corresponding `Punctuator` (which would be `Punctuator.ADD`). we could then use the `Punctuator.prototype()` method to create a new `LextantToken` representing an addition operation at the current location in the text.

The commented out code at the end of the enum indicates an alternate, more efficient way to implement the `forLexeme()` method using a hashtable. This can be faster because it allows for constant-time lookup of punctuators by lexeme, rather than the linear-time search implemented by the `rawForLexeme()` method. However, this optimization might come at the cost of readability and simplicity.

EXAMPLE:

Let's consider the following source code that the compiler is analyzing:

```
let a = 2;
let b = 3;
let sum = a + b;
```

As the compiler scans the code, it converts the source code into a stream of tokens. A token represents a component of the source code that is meaningful in the context of the programming language syntax, like identifiers, operators, brackets, etc.

Now, let's focus on the third line `let sum = a + b;`.

As the compiler scans this line, it reads the characters one-by-one, recognizing the following tokens:

- `let` keyword
- `sum` identifier
- `=` assignment operator
- `a` identifier
- `+` addition operator
- `b` identifier
- `;` statement terminator

Now, when the scanner in the compiler encounters the `+` character, it needs to create a token representing this operator. This is where the `Punctuator` enum and `PartiallyScannedPunctuator` class come into play.

Here's how it happens in a simplified way:

1. The scanner reads a character from the source code. Let's say it's a `+`.
2. It checks if this character can start a punctuator using `PunctuatorScanningAids.isPunctuatorStartingCharacter('+')`.
3. If it's true, it calls `PunctuatorScanner.scan()` function, passing the `+` character and the input stream.
4. Inside `PunctuatorScanner`, a `PartiallyScannedPunctuator` object is created. This object holds the `+` character.
5. The scanner then tries to match the `PartiallyScannedPunctuator`'s string with a `Punctuator`. It calls `PartiallyScannedPunctuator.asPunctuator()`, which internally calls `Punctuator.forLexeme("+")`.
6. The `Punctuator.forLexeme("+")` call returns `Punctuator.ADD` because the "+" lexeme matches the `ADD` enum value.
7. Now that it has a match, the scanner creates a new token for this operator using the `PartiallyScannedPunctuator.asToken()` method, which returns a `LextantToken` representing the `+` operator in the source code.
8. This new token is then added to the stream of tokens that will be parsed in the next stage of the compiler.

This process is repeated for every character in the source code, resulting in a stream of tokens that accurately represent the structure of the original code.
